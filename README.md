# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Repository for Module 14 Challenge

## Overview

This interactive dashboard explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels. The project showcases the microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) present in more than 70% of people, highlighting the diversity of bacteria living in human belly buttons. This dataset provides a fascinating glimpse into the microscopic world in our midst.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file for the dashboard.
- `samples.json`: The dataset file containing the OTU data.
- `static/`: 
  - `app.js`: JavaScript file for handling the dashboard logic.
